# Seekout 

We want to make looking for stuff easier. Flip the script as you will. Instead of putting in the effor to find what you are looking for, 
put seekers to work and be alerted when what you want is available.

I'm working on a few I care about currently, but I'm sure there are more
features and sites that others would love to have included as well.
